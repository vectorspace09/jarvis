# .cursorrules file for the voice-enabled conversational AI assistant

project_description: |
  This project develops a voice-enabled AI assistant, inspired by Jarvis from Ironman, that uses STT and TTS for voice interactions. It is powered by OpenAIâ€™s Assistant API for conversational intelligence, and supports tasks like scheduling, reminders, and to-do lists. Supabase is used for data storage, while APScheduler handles task notifications.
